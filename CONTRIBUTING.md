# Contributing Guidelines
We appriciate constructive criticism of our code! We are 4 students that haven't been coding for a long time, and happily take notes on improvements etc. <3

## 📥 Contact us 📥
So since we're just four students doing this for a project, you can email this email: mast0006@stud.ek.dk for any issues/tickets about our program, or if you wanna ask questions about our project!:)

## 🔁 Opening an issue 🔁
Before opening a issue make sure you have the latest version of our Project. 

(_Please note after the 17th of Jan 2025, the project will no longer be updated by us._)

### 🪲 Bug reports 🪲
Bug reports are a great way to help us make our program better and for us to learn aswell!

Feel free to email us at the email mentioned earlier with a detailed problem or bug. Otherwise you can open a issue with the problems you encounter. 

Please be as detailed as you can be, since we are new programmers so we won't be understanding all the fancy code! 💌

## 📝 Closing thoughts 📝
Since we are new at programming and new to GitHub as a whole aswell, we're still taking most of the feedback and contributions via email mostly. Thanks for reading our contributing file and may you have a blessed day, Goden Entertainment out 💅
